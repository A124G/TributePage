                    of the Boring Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of December 2023, according to the
                    Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $254 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.[5][6]<br/><br/>

                    <strong><u>Early Life And Education</u></strong><br /> Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[11][12] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[13][14] His mother, Maye
                    Musk (n√©e Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[15][16][17] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer,
                    who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[18][19][20][21] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[17][22]
                    <br/><br/> Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[21] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike
                    of apartheid.[11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26] After his parents
                    divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[13][18] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[27] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[23][28]<br/><br/>

                    <strong><u>Personal Life</u></strong><br />From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[483] He then relocated to Texas, saying that California had become "complacent"
                    about its economic success.[483][484] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[485][486] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing
                    for the proposed fight between himself and Mark Zuckerberg.[487] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[488][489]<br/><br/>

                    <strong><u>Bussiness Career</u></strong><br />In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed to Zip2.[57][58] The company was financed mainly through a financing round of US$200,000,
                    of which 10% was contributed by his father Errol Musk.[59] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[60] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[61]
                    with Musk coding the website every night.[61] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[51] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[62] however,
                    Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[63] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[64][65] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[66]</p>
